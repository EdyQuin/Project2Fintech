# FintechProject2
## Project 2 for UM Fintech BC
## Description
+ This project ("Project 2") is required by the UM BC class. Here, I will analyze datasets using Regression techniques and Natural Language techniques taught/learned in the UM class. The datasets focus on natural disasters and other disasters which have occured in the United States in the last 10-12 years. The datasets range from articles and tweets to time series data. Thus, the use of Regression techniques to analyze the time series data (continuous data) and attempt to make some predictions, and Natural Language Techniques to analyze the text data (categorical data) to understand what is being said/written. 
+ What can we use Machine Learning for? 

## Contributor
+ Eduardo "Edy" Quin

## Usage
+ The analyses and visualizations are aimed to be educational and a display of what has been learned and understood so far by the student. However, this type of modeling is useful to insurance companies, construction companies/builders, and government agencies that focus on these types of events (natural disasters/other large scale disaster events).

## The objective for Project 2
+ The objective for Project 2 is to showcase what we have learned so far in the UM BC class. Under Machine Learning there are two main categories utilized: 1. Classification and 2. Regression under either Supervised or Unsupervised models. This approach allows us to classify and predict based on data, for example, time series data. Both models utilize regression techniques. Natural Language Processing, NLP, "allows us to process human language [using computers] so that it can be used in Machine Learning and Software Applications." NLP is a "sub-filed" of Artificial Intelligence, AI. Computer, or Machines, cannot readily work with natural human language, or raw text. Thus, we have to convert the text into "vector numbers" using NLP techniques.
 
## Use cases 
+ Insurance
+ Construction
+ Disaster Logistics
+ Government

## Final Word
+ Machine Learning is a developing field and along with data science it can assist humans in solving complex problems. However, the existing techniques are indispensable in certain domains, for example finance, insurance, and government. Machine Learning can be used to classify and predict based on categorical and continuous data, but in order to classify or predict you require data. Using the tools referenced above, among many others, and the many technique available will save costs and time.
